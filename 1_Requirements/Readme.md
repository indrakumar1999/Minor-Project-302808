# Requirements
## Introduction
Need for electricity has been growing globally at a very fast rate and is expected to increase more with the use of electric vehicles and other electronic appliances. Also decrease in fossil fuels and increase in pollution levels increases the dependence upon renewable energy sources. Among these renewable sources, solar is the one of the best options since it has  high potential and abundant in nature. These Renewable energy sources have the problem of energy storage and by the use of Electrical Energy Storage it can be resolved. Energy storage popularity has increased in residential due to its good contribution in electrical distribution system network also due to great economic performance of solar system. The energy storage for distribution systems has been a really huge advantage. 

## Research

PV plants at the residential levels had a good impact on the network and adding energy storing at the residential level should have great effectiveness too. The main aim for this system is using both grid and PV to supply power to the residence at all times. The installation of PV-battery system in households is aimed to increase self-consumption of solar energy, also the owner’s self-reliance. The PV system alone is really expensive to be used for residential use and many people don’t prefer is for the same. And a lot of power gets wasted when the irradiance is very high. But all these problems can be solved by adding a battery system to the circuit. Storing the PV power could make a positive impact on the overall system. Also, the use of Grid with PV ensures full time power supply and cost management. The electricity bill gets reduced too.
Almost same technique is used in the Electric Vehicle for charging and discharging of battery. The most common type are V2G and G2V. In V2G that is vehicle to grid system the battery energy can be transfered to the grid or can be used to supply power to home. V2G can be used to implement net metering. And in G2V that is grid to vehicle, grid or other source of energy is used to charge the battery of EV. So, almost same concept is used for battery charging and discharging process in electric vehicle. The only difference is load. If we remove the load from this system the same system can be implemented in electric vehicle. 
## Cost and Features
No. |  Type   |    Cost(INR)    
-------|---------|----------------
1 | 2kW On-grid solar | Rs 1,00,000 Onward
2 | 2kW off-grid solar | Rs 1,50,000 Onward
3 | 2kW Hybrid solar  | Rs 1,65,000 Onward
## Defining Our System
The system have different source of energy like PV Solar, Grid and Battery. And it work in both Islanded mode and Grid Connected mode. In islanded mode of operation there are three mode. And depending on the load demand, SOC(battery power) of batter and irradiance(PV power) different modes will operate. There are three type of converter are used and they are boost converter, bi-directional dc-dc converter and 3 level bridge converter. The main objective behind this project is to provide continuous power supply and to save electricity cost for the user.
